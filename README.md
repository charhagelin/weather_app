# weather_app

### Our first team challenge at CFA

We decided to creater an app that would return the current weather anywhere in Australia, if the user would like also give a list of the major cities and and their current temperature, and finnaly be able to provide the user with directions how to get there.

through this process we used Trello to hold our user storie as well as a program flow.

we wanted to create an app that could:
* return current weather for the location input by the user
* ask the user if they were happy with the current temperature in their location
* if not, it would ask what their ideal temeprature would be
* this input would generate a list of places with a current temperature close to the users wish 
* the user would be able to chose a location from this list and request directions how to get there

in the end we created an app that could:
* return current weather for the location input by the user
* ask the user if they want to see a list of major cities and their current temperature 
* if yes, genereate a table with major cities in Australia and their current temperature 
* ask the user if they would like directions to any of the listed cities
* if yes, have the user pick a city 
* generate directions to chosen city

During the process of creating this app we had to change a few things we originally planned. 
For one we originally wanted to have the user be a ble to input a city anywhere on eart, but we ran in to problems with giving directions. In the end we could only give directions within Australia, so we have to limit ourselfs to only Australian cities. 
We also count not find a way to generate a list of cities through the input of a temperature
